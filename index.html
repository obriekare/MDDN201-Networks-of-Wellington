		</nav>

		<p>Network systems and connections have become a modern necessity. While I thought I would have to venture into the city to find evidence of different Network and internet systems, I found many just walking around my own suburb. Even on just a 5 minute walk to the shops it was impossible to not encounter multiple manholes.
		In my own home, I started noticing as well how many different parts connected me to a larger network with a wifi router, ethernet cables and  my computer's wifi card.</p>

		<p>This website is a documentation of different Networks I have found around not only Newlands, Wellington, but also my own home and the immediate surrounding area. </p>

				<h3>Ethernet Cable</h3>
				<p>Ethernet Cables are a staple when it comes to supplying internet to both personal devices and wifi routers. Essentially, this cable connects two wired devices together whether it be for file sharing or wifi connection when connecting your router to your laptop or desktop computer.

				<h3>ONT Box</h3>
				<p>An ONT box can be found installed in any home that supports a wifi connection system. ONT's, standing for Optical Network Terminal, are devices used for fiber-optic network systems.
				Used in correspondence with your wifi router, the ONT converts optical signals into electrical signals and electrical signals into optical. In simpler terms, this means that the ONT connects your modem to the broadband/fibre Termination Point (TP) that is wired to the exterior of your house. </p>

				<h3>PCI E Card</h3>
				<p>This PCI E card, or Peripheral component interconnect express, is installed into the motherboard of my personal desktop computer so I am able to connect to my wifi router. It consists of two antennae that stick out the back of the desktop PC case.</p>

				<h3>Wifi Router</h3>
				<p>Wireless routers are what most people think of when it comes to sources of wireless networks due to them being found in nearly every modern home, public facility and business. This router is connected to the ONT box by an ethernet cable, allowing any device in close enough vicinity to connect to the internet by
				both recieving and transmitting signals. </p>

				<h3>External Termination Point (ETP)</h3>
				<p>The external termination point is a box installed on the outside of your house where access to your home's personal fibre network can be found. This is where your wifi is initially hooked up to and where you would first test for any faults in your fibre connection.
				I found this particular ETP on the outside of my house, in terms of relation to the position of the ONT, my ETP is positioned on the opposite external side of the wall so both are as close to each other as possible.</p>

				<h3>Manholes</h3>
				<p>While walking around my community I noticed a lot of manholes along the street and outside residential houses. Even though these come in multiple different shapes and sizes, they all serve the same purpose of covering pit access to street cable chambers.</p>

				<h3>Plinths</h3>
				<p>As well as manholes, I also noticed a lot of plinths along the street outside around each private property. Unlike manholes, these sit above ground and connect the network from a larger supply cabinet to your property boundary.</p>
